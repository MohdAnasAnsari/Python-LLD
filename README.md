## 1. Most Asked Coding Questions in High-Paying Companies (1-2 Years Experience)

Iâ€™ll focus on the most common topics and questions that are frequently asked in coding interviews for candidates with 1-2 years of experience. I'll apply the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to identify and list the most critical questions that cover the majority of concepts you might encounter.

### Common Topics:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- Recursion
- Hash Tables
